## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Large-screen-first workflow
- javscript

### What I learned ?

I learned some awesome stuff like how to build the lightbox and update the UI dynamically based on user interactions, also learned how to make my personal framework like building a class just to center any element by setting the top and left to 50% and translate it with transform translate as showing in code below.

```css
.center-element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  -webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  -moz-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  -o-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
